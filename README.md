# BERT & GPT Optimizer Benchmarking for NLP

This project evaluates and compares multiple optimization algorithms — **AdamW**, **LAMB**, **SGD**, and **AdaFactor** — with learning rate warmup for fine-tuning transformer-based models (**BERT** and **GPT**) on the **SST-2 sentiment classification** task.

While testing, **SGD consistently yielded poor accuracy and instability** on the SST-2 dataset. To further investigate, we attempted fine-tuning the **GPT model** using **SGD** on the **SQuAD (Stanford Question Answering Dataset)**. Unfortunately, the results confirmed the trend — **accuracy remained low**, suggesting that SGD is not well-suited for fine-tuning large transformer models in this context.

## 📝 How to Run

# Load dataset and tokenizer
from datasets import load_dataset
from transformers import AutoTokenizer

dataset = load_dataset("glue", "sst2")
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("bert-base-uncased")

# Then follow each notebook to run fine-tuning with a specific optimizer.
